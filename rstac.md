# Download data from a STAC API using R and rstac

This tutorial walks through querying a STAC API using the
[rstac](https://brazil-data-cube.github.io/rstac/) R package, and
downloading data from the API using rstac or [GDAL](https://gdal.org/)
(via [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf)). This tutorial will assume
that you’re already familiar with [the R
language](https://cran.r-project.org/) and the
[terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra) package.

As all of the packages we’ll be using are available from CRAN, you can
install them (if necessary) using `install.packages()`:

``` r
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("rstac")
install.packages("terra")
```

STAC APIs are servers that provide access to a set of data which users
can query and retrieve. You can find a partial list of STAC APIs at
[STAC Index, https://stacindex.org/](https://stacindex.org/). For this
tutorial, we’ll be downloading data from Microsoft’s [Planetary
Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com), which currently
provides more than 100 data sets for free via a central STAC API.

To start downloading data, we’ll first need to let rstac know what STAC
API we want to query and download from. To do so, we’ll pass the URL of
the Planetary Computer STAC API to the `rstac::stac()` function:

``` r
stac_source <- rstac::stac(
  "https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1"
)
stac_source
```

    ###RSTACQuery
    - url: https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1
    - params:
    - field(s): version, base_url, endpoint, params, verb, encode

As you can see, the output of `stac()` is an `RSTACQuery` object, which
contains information about an HTTP query that we might want to run in
the future. Under the hood, these objects are normal lists containing
information about the query:

``` r
str(stac_source)
```

    List of 6
     $ version : NULL
     $ base_url: chr "https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1"
     $ endpoint: NULL
     $ params  : list()
     $ verb    : chr "GET"
     $ encode  : NULL
     - attr(*, "class")= chr [1:2] "stac" "RSTACQuery"

But most of the time, you won’t need to worry about this internal
representation; rstac provides many helper functions to access the
elements of this list if needed.

It’s worth highlighting that this object is a representation of a
*future* HTTP query, not the results of a query we’ve already run! In
order to actually run these queries, we need to use
`rstac::get_request()` (or `rstac::post_request()`, depending on what
HTTP verb your STAC API is expecting). If we use `get_request()` to
query the Planetary Computer STAC API, we get a brief description of
what this API provides:

``` r
rstac::get_request(stac_source)
```

    ###STACCatalog
    - id: microsoft-pc
    - description: 
    Searchable spatiotemporal metadata describing Earth science datasets hosted by the Microsoft Planetary Computer
    - field(s): type, id, title, description, stac_version, conformsTo, links

Because the `RSTACQuery` object is a representation of a future query,
we can use other functions in rstac to change our query parameters and
fields before we actually make a request. For instance, we can use
`rstac::collections()` to update our request to query the `/collections`
endpoint of the Planetary Computer API, which lists all the available
[collections](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/collection-spec/collection-spec.md)
(which, to quote the STAC Collection specification, “describe a group of
[Items](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/item-spec/item-spec.md)
that share properties and metadata”):

``` r
collections_query <- stac_source |>
  rstac::collections()

collections_query
```

    ###RSTACQuery
    - url: https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1
    - params:
    - field(s): version, base_url, endpoint, params, verb, encode

While it might not look like much has changed, under the hood our
`collections_query` object has a new `collections` class to indicate
that we’re querying the collections endpoint, not the top-level STAC
endpoint:

``` r
class(stac_source)
```

    [1] "stac"       "RSTACQuery"

``` r
class(collections_query)
```

    [1] "collections" "RSTACQuery" 

And as a result, when we use `get_request()` to turn this query
*specification* into a query *result*, we get a list of the collections
available from this API:

``` r
available_collections <- rstac::get_request(collections_query)
available_collections
```

    ###STACCollectionList
    - collections (122 item(s)):
      - daymet-annual-pr
      - daymet-daily-hi
      - 3dep-seamless
      - 3dep-lidar-dsm
      - fia
      - sentinel-1-rtc
      - gridmet
      - daymet-annual-na
      - daymet-monthly-na
      - daymet-annual-hi
      - ... with 112 more collection(s).
    - field(s): collections, links

These collections are a subset of the data sets available in the
[Planetary Computer data
catalog](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog); the Planetary
Computer is organized so that each collection corresponds to a distinct
data set in the catalog.

For our purposes today, we’re going to be querying the [USGS Land Change
Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection
(LCMAP)](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/usgs-lcmap-conus-v13)
collection, which provides (among other things) annual land cover
classifications for the continental United States. We can query what
items are available for this collection using the `rstac::stac_search()`
function. We’ll limit our search to 2021 using the `datetime` argument,
and only search within the LCMAP collection by using the collection’s ID
of `usgs-lcmap-conus-v13`:

``` r
rstac::stac_search(
  q = stac_source,
  collections = "usgs-lcmap-conus-v13",
  datetime = "2021-01-01/2021-12-31"
) |> 
  rstac::get_request()
```

    ###STACItemCollection
    - features (250 item(s)):
      - LCMAP_CU_032003_2021_V13_CCDC
      - LCMAP_CU_031006_2021_V13_CCDC
      - LCMAP_CU_031004_2021_V13_CCDC
      - LCMAP_CU_031003_2021_V13_CCDC
      - LCMAP_CU_031002_2021_V13_CCDC
      - LCMAP_CU_030007_2021_V13_CCDC
      - LCMAP_CU_030006_2021_V13_CCDC
      - LCMAP_CU_030005_2021_V13_CCDC
      - LCMAP_CU_030004_2021_V13_CCDC
      - LCMAP_CU_030003_2021_V13_CCDC
      - ... with 240 more feature(s).
    - assets: 
    browse, dates, lcachg, lcachg_metadata, lcpconf, lcpconf_metadata, lcpri, lcpri_metadata, lcsconf, lcsconf_metadata, lcsec, lcsec_metadata, rendered_preview, sclast, sclast_metadata, scmag, scmag_metadata, scmqa, scmqa_metadata, scstab, scstab_metadata, sctime, sctime_metadata, tilejson
    - item's fields: 
    assets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, stac_extensions, stac_version, type

We can see that there are 250 items inside this catalog for 2021.
Collectively, these items contain all LCMAP data for the continental
United States for 2021, with each item containing a number of assets
covering a relatively small chunk of the nation. These assets are
“object\[s\] that \[contain\] a URI to data associated with the Item
that can be downloaded or streamed”, to quote [the
spec](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/item-spec/item-spec.md#asset-object);
here, assets are things like “primary land cover classification” or “a
metadata object”.

To keep things simple, we’ll start off downloading data for a relatively
small region, namely North Carolina’s Ashe County. We’ll use data
included in the sf package to get the county’s geometry:

``` r
ashe <- sf::read_sf(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))[1, ]

sf::st_geometry(ashe) |> plot()
```

<img
src="rstac.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png"
id="fig-539a35d47e664c97a50115a146a7f1bd-1" />

To filter our query down to just tiles intersecting this region, we’ll
need to provide the bounding box of the county in
[WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) as a query
parameter. We can use `sf::st_transform()` to reproject the county and
`sf::st_bbox()` to find our bounding box:

``` r
ashe_bbox <- ashe |>
  sf::st_transform(4326) |>
  sf::st_bbox()

ashe_bbox
```

         xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax 
    -81.74091  36.23448 -81.23970  36.58977 

We can then pass this bounding box directly to the `bbox` argument of
`stac_search` to filter our results down further:

``` r
stac_query <- rstac::stac_search(
  q = stac_source,
  collections = "usgs-lcmap-conus-v13",
  bbox = ashe_bbox,
  datetime = "2021-01-01/2021-12-31"
)

executed_stac_query <- rstac::get_request(stac_query)

executed_stac_query
```

    ###STACItemCollection
    - features (1 item(s)):
      - LCMAP_CU_025011_2021_V13_CCDC
    - assets: 
    browse, dates, lcachg, lcachg_metadata, lcpconf, lcpconf_metadata, lcpri, lcpri_metadata, lcsconf, lcsconf_metadata, lcsec, lcsec_metadata, rendered_preview, sclast, sclast_metadata, scmag, scmag_metadata, scmqa, scmqa_metadata, scstab, scstab_metadata, sctime, sctime_metadata, tilejson
    - item's fields: 
    assets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, stac_extensions, stac_version, type

As luck would have it, Ashe County is entirely contained in a single
LCMAP tile.

There are a few different ways to download the assets associated with
this item. First, we could use the `rstac::assets_download()` function.
Before we can download assets, however, we’re going to need to
[authenticate ourselves with Planetary
Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/concepts/sas/).
Note that this doesn’t require an account or registration, but rather is
a way for Microsoft to uniquely identify your Planetary Computer session
and impose rate limits if needed.

This authentication process is built-in to rstac, using the
`items_sign()` and `sign_planetary_computer()` functions:

``` r
signed_stac_query <- rstac::items_sign(
  executed_stac_query,
  rstac::sign_planetary_computer()
)

signed_stac_query
```

    ###STACItemCollection
    - features (1 item(s)):
      - LCMAP_CU_025011_2021_V13_CCDC
    - assets: 
    browse, dates, lcachg, lcachg_metadata, lcpconf, lcpconf_metadata, lcpri, lcpri_metadata, lcsconf, lcsconf_metadata, lcsec, lcsec_metadata, rendered_preview, sclast, sclast_metadata, scmag, scmag_metadata, scmqa, scmqa_metadata, scstab, scstab_metadata, sctime, sctime_metadata, tilejson
    - item's fields: 
    assets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, stac_extensions, stac_version, type

We didn’t need to log in or register anywhere, but now have
authenticated our requests and will be able to download assets from this
STAC API.

We’ll then use this signed query object with `assets_download()` to
actually retrieve our assets. We’ll provide the name of what assets we
want to download – let’s start off by downloading `lcpri`, which
contains the primary land cover classifications for this area:

``` r
rstac::assets_download(signed_stac_query, "lcpri", output_dir = tempdir())
```

We’re downloading these into a temporary directory (using `tempdir()`)
so that these example files will be cleaned up after we finish running
this tutorial. In practice, you’ll likely want to set `output_dir`
somewhere else, where the data will persist for as long as you need.

The `assets_download()` function will save your data in a sub-directory
of `output_dir` that corresponds to the URL that the asset is being
downloaded from. In this case, that winds up being quite a long folder
path – but once we type the folder path out, we can load our downloaded
raster into R and use it with terra and other raster packages as normal:

``` r
output_file <- file.path(
  tempdir(),
  "lcmap",
  "CU",
  "V13",
  "025011",
  "2021",
  "LCMAP_CU_025011_2021_20220721_V13_CCDC",
  "LCMAP_CU_025011_2021_20220629_V13_LCPRI.tif"
) |>
  terra::rast()

terra::plot(output_file)
```

id="fig-539a35d47e664c97a50115a146a7f1bd-2" />

The `assets_download()` function is an easy and straightforward way to
download assets associated with a STAC Item, and by passing multiple
asset names (or leaving the `asset_names` argument `NULL`) we could use
this function to download more than one asset at a time. This function
can also handle any format an asset is stored in, making it a flexible
way to download rasters, metadata, vectors, or whatever other data is
provided by a STAC API.

The main downside of this approach, however, is that we can’t use it to
download only specific parts of an asset, which means we can wind up
downloading much more data than we need. For instance, look at how far
our land cover raster extends beyond Ashe County’s borders:

``` r
terra::plot(output_file)
ashe |>
  sf::st_transform(sf::st_crs(output_file)) |>
  sf::st_geometry() |>
  plot(add = TRUE, lwd = 3)
```

<img
src="rstac.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png"
id="fig-539a35d47e664c97a50115a146a7f1bd-3" />

An alternative approach for downloading raster assets is to use [GDAL’s
virtual file system
interface](https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html) to download
rasters. If the STAC server stores the asset in a cloud-friendly format,
such as [COG](https://www.cogeo.org/), then GDAL is able to download
only the necessary pieces of the raster, potentially speeding up
download times and reducing bandwidth usage.

To download assets using GDAL, we need to extract the URL for our assets
from our *unsigned* STAC query results. We can get the URL for the
`lcpri` asset using `rstac::assets_url()`:

``` r
lcpri_url <- rstac::assets_url(executed_stac_query, "lcpri")
lcpri_url
```

    [1] "https://landcoverdata.blob.core.windows.net/lcmap/CU/V13/025011/2021/LCMAP_CU_025011_2021_20220721_V13_CCDC/LCMAP_CU_025011_2021_20220629_V13_LCPRI.tif"

In order for this URL to work with GDAL’s virtual filesystem interface,
we’ll need to append a few things in front of the URL. Namely, we’ll
need to add:

-   `/vsicurl`, to specify that we want to use the [http-based virtual
    filesytem
    interface](https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html#vsicurl-http-https-ftp-files-random-access),
-   `pc_url_signing=yes`, to use GDAL’s built-in method for signing
    requests to Microsoft’s Planetary Computer,
-   and `pc_collection=usgs-lcmap-conus-v13`, to let GDAL know what
    collection we need authentication for.

All of these configuration parameters are documented in the official
[GDAL
documentation](https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html#vsicurl-http-https-ftp-files-random-access).

We can write a small function that will paste these parameters on to any
URL we want:

``` r
make_vsicurl_url <- function(base_url) {
  paste0(
    "/vsicurl", 
    "?pc_url_signing=yes",
    "&pc_collection=usgs-lcmap-conus-v13",
    "&url=",
    base_url
  )
}
```

We might have chosen to make this function a bit more flexible by adding
a `collection` argument, so that we can sign requests for data in any
collection we’d want. For our purposes here, however, this simpler
function should suffice.

We can then use this function to modify our LCMAP URL:

``` r
lcpri_url <- make_vsicurl_url(lcpri_url)
```

Next, we’ll download the `lcpri` asset from this URL using
`sf::gdal_utils()`, which provides access to GDAL’s C++ utilities. We’ll
use the included interface to
[gdalwarp](https://gdal.org/programs/gdalwarp.html) to both download and
reproject our data, using the `t_srs` and `te` arguments to gdalwarp to
control the spatial reference system and the extent of our downloaded
raster:

``` r
out_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".tif")
sf::gdal_utils(
  "warp",
  source = lcpri_url,
  destination = out_file,
  options = c(
    "-t_srs", sf::st_crs(ashe)$wkt,
    "-te", sf::st_bbox(ashe)
  )
)
```

This download runs a good bit faster than using `assets_download()`, and
results in a smaller raster covering only our area of interest,
reprojected into the same CRS as our original data:

``` r
terra::rast(out_file) |>
  terra::plot()
ashe |>
  sf::st_geometry() |>
  plot(lwd = 3, add = TRUE)
```

<img
src="rstac.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png"
id="fig-539a35d47e664c97a50115a146a7f1bd-4" />

At this point, we’ve walked through how to use rstac to query a STAC
API, and how to use either rstac or GDAL to download assets found in
these queries. It’s worth highlighting that so far we’ve only needed to
write about 40 lines of code; here’s everything we’ve walked through so
far, presented as a single script instead of in a bunch of chunks:

``` r
ashe <- sf::read_sf(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))[1, ]
ashe_bbox <- ashe |>
  sf::st_transform(4326) |>
  sf::st_bbox()

stac_query <- rstac::stac(
  "https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1"
) |>
  rstac::stac_search(
    collections = "usgs-lcmap-conus-v13",
    bbox = ashe_bbox,
    datetime = "2021-01-01/2021-12-31"
  ) |>
  rstac::get_request()

make_vsicurl_url <- function(base_url) {
  paste0(
    "/vsicurl", 
    "?pc_url_signing=yes",
    "&pc_collection=usgs-lcmap-conus-v13",
    "&url=",
    base_url
  )
}

lcpri_url <- make_vsicurl_url(rstac::assets_url(stac_query, "lcpri"))

out_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".tif")
sf::gdal_utils(
  "warp",
  source = lcpri_url,
  destination = out_file,
  options = c(
    "-t_srs", sf::st_crs(ashe)$wkt,
    "-te", sf::st_bbox(ashe)
  )
)

terra::rast(out_file) |>
  terra::plot()
ashe |> 
  sf::st_geometry() |> 
  plot(lwd = 3, add = TRUE)
```

<img
src="rstac.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png"
id="fig-539a35d47e664c97a50115a146a7f1bd-5" />

What if we wanted to download more than one raster asset? We could
choose to pass multiple asset names to `assets_download()`. For
instance, if we wanted to also download the secondary land cover
classification for this area (called `lcsec`), we could write:

``` r
rstac::assets_download(
  signed_stac_query, 
  c("lcpri", "lcsec"), 
  output_dir = tempdir(),
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

Note that we needed to set `overwrite = TRUE`, in order to re-download
the `lcpri` asset that we had already retrieved.

These rasters are now somewhere in our `output_dir` directory. We can
find their file paths using `list.files()` in order to load and
visualize them:

``` r
list.files(
  file.path(tempdir(), "lcmap"),
  recursive = TRUE,
  full.names = TRUE
) |> 
  terra::rast() |>
  terra::plot()
```

<img
src="rstac.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png"
id="fig-539a35d47e664c97a50115a146a7f1bd-6" />

If we wanted to download multiple assets using sf and GDAL, we’d need to
run our `gdal_utils()` call for each asset we wanted to download. For
instance, to download both `lcpri` and `lcsec`, we could run:

``` r
vapply(
  make_vsicurl_url(rstac::assets_url(stac_query, c("lcpri", "lcsec"))),
  function(asset_url) {
    out_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".tif")
    sf::gdal_utils(
      "warp",
      source = asset_url,
      destination = out_file,
      options = c(
        "-t_srs", sf::st_crs(ashe)$wkt,
        "-te", sf::st_bbox(ashe)
      )
    )
    out_file
  },
  character(1)
) |> 
  terra::rast() |> 
  terra::plot()
```

<img
src="rstac.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png"
id="fig-539a35d47e664c97a50115a146a7f1bd-7" />

What if we wanted to download the same asset from more than one item?
For instance, what if we wanted to download `lcpri` for all of North
Carolina?

We could construct our STAC query in almost exactly the same way as
before, except using the entire `nc` data frame instead of just its
first row:

``` r
nc <- sf::read_sf(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))
nc_bbox <- nc |>
  sf::st_transform(4326) |>
  sf::st_bbox()

stac_query <- rstac::stac(
  "https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1"
) |>
  rstac::stac_search(
    collections = "usgs-lcmap-conus-v13",
    bbox = nc_bbox,
    datetime = "2021-01-01/2021-12-31"
  ) |>
  rstac::get_request()
  
signed_query <- stac_query |>   
  rstac::items_sign(
    rstac::sign_planetary_computer()
  )

signed_query
```

    ###STACItemCollection
    - features (20 item(s)):
      - LCMAP_CU_029012_2021_V13_CCDC
      - LCMAP_CU_029011_2021_V13_CCDC
      - LCMAP_CU_028013_2021_V13_CCDC

      - LCMAP_CU_027011_2021_V13_CCDC
      - LCMAP_CU_027010_2021_V13_CCDC
      - ... with 10 more feature(s).
    - assets: 
    browse, dates, lcachg, lcachg_metadata, lcpconf, lcpconf_metadata, lcpri, lcpri_metadata, lcsconf, lcsconf_metadata, lcsec, lcsec_metadata, rendered_preview, sclast, sclast_metadata, scmag, scmag_metadata, scmqa, scmqa_metadata, scstab, scstab_metadata, sctime, sctime_metadata, tilejson
    - item's fields: 
    assets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, stac_extensions, stac_version, type

As you can see, we now have 20 items to download, rather than just 1!

We barely need to change our code at all to download all 20 `lcpri`
assets from these items using `assets_download()`. We’re simply going to
set `progress = FALSE`, in order to keep the output from this function
clean. Other than that, we don’t need to change a thing:

``` r
rstac::assets_download(
  signed_query, 
  "lcpri",
  output_dir = tempdir(),
  overwrite = TRUE,
  progress = FALSE
)

These files are each saved into their own folder inside of `output_dir`.
We can use `list.files()` to get the paths to each of them, and then
`terra::sprc()` and `terra::mosaic()` to combine them into a single
raster:

``` r
lcpri <- list.files(
  file.path(tempdir(), "lcmap"),
  pattern = "LCPRI.tif",
  recursive = TRUE,
  full.names = TRUE
) |> 
  lapply(terra::rast) |> 
  terra::sprc() |> 
  terra::mosaic()

terra::plot(lcpri)
nc |> 
  sf::st_transform(sf::st_crs(lcpri)) |> 
  sf::st_geometry() |>
  plot(lwd = 3, add = TRUE)
```

Note that we’ve lost our color palette due to `mosaic()`, but this is
the same data as we’ve been working with throughout the entire tutorial.

Or alternatively, we can use our `gdal_utils()` call – without any edits
– to download and merge these files together. Remember that we’re using
our *unsigned* query results here!

``` r
out_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".tif")
sf::gdal_utils(
  "warp",
  source = make_vsicurl_url(rstac::assets_url(stac_query, "lcpri")),
  destination = out_file,
  options = c(
    "-t_srs", sf::st_crs(nc)$wkt,
    "-te", sf::st_bbox(nc)
  )
)

terra::rast(out_file) |>
  terra::plot()
nc |> 
  sf::st_geometry() |> 
  plot(lwd = 3, add = TRUE)
```

<img
src="rstac.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png"
id="fig-539a35d47e664c97a50115a146a7f1bd-9" />

Note that gdalwarp does not interpolate between overlapping pixels, and
instead simply uses the value from whichever pixel it processed last.
That’s fine here, where our tiles shouldn’t overlap (and pixel values
should be identical if they do), but means you shouldn’t use gdalwarp to
combine images from multiple time periods into a single composite.

It’s worth highlighting that these are just two methods among many for
downloading this data – you may also find using packages such as
[terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra) or
[gdalcubes](https://gdalcubes.github.io/) useful for getting data from
STAC APIs!
